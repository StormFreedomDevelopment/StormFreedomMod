StormFreedomMod is based off the TotalFreedomMod created by Steven Lawson and Darth Salomon, therefore, known as Prozza And Madgeek, Joshua Black also known as xEpson created the StormFreedomMod as a plugin for the StormFreedom server, no changes can be made to the StormFreedomMod without being the rank “Developer”, editing the mod without the rank can result in big punishment, therefore a suspension for 8 weeks, this goes for any rank below Lead-Developer, if any owner edits StormFreedomMod, the StormFreedomMod will be replaced, considering we have backups. Specifically Owners can ask the Lead-Developer to edit the mod, and simply with they’re going to edit, but the Lead-Developer can simply say no, there is no need to make a fuss over this.
